 *	\brief This class is responsible for all methods associated with a loaded application.
 *	All events generated to the application should be sent by using the methods of this class.
 *  Also, the management of resources for a single application should also be maintained by this
 *  class, so thread pools, datasources, caching, etc. should all be part of this.
 *  One instance of this class should correspond to a running process.
