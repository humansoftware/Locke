 *	\brief This class is responsible for application discovering in the autodeploy dir and for any method
 *	associated with loading and unload applications. This class should maintain the list of opened
 *	applications, should be smart enough to create a process for each application and to serve as a
 *	"watchdog" for applications that crash and should be restarted if possible.
